# Password Generator React App
I'm now (August 26, 2024) a beginner React developer. Even though I've done a lot of projects in the past, I'm new to React.<br>This is one of my beginner projects.

I'll explain how everything works in this project. 

 * The code works by using the useState hook to store the different state values, such as the password, the number of characters, and
 whether the user wants to include capital letters, small letters,
 numbers, and special characters.
 
 * The genpass function takes in the number of characters, and the
 boolean values for whether the user wants to include each of the
 character types, and then generates a password by looping through
 the different character types and adding characters to the password
 string.
 
 * The genpass function is called when the user clicks the "Generate
 Password" button, and the new password is then displayed in the
 input field.
 
 * The user can also change the state values by interacting with the
 input fields and checkboxes.
